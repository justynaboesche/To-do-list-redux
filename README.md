## Demo
[See my to-do list](https://justynaboesche.github.io/todo-list-react/)
## Description
This is my next project created in the process of becoming the **Frontend Developer**. I have created a simple to-do list that allows you to add new tasks to the list below,
mark completed tasks and remove tasks from the list. You can also hide and show tasks that are marked as done and mark all tasks as done. The application has been prepared to be used in convenient way also on smaller devices.
## How it works
At the beginning you need to enter your first task. To add the task to the list below, you need to click the "Dodaj zadanie" button. You can add to the list as many tasks, as you want. If you want to mark one of the completed tasks, you can click the green button. You can also remove a task from the list by clicking the red button. If you want to hide tasks that are marked as done, click the 'Ukryj ukończone' button, and if you want to show them once again, click the 'Pokaż ukończone' button. There is also possibility to mark all tasks as done by clicking the 'Ukończ wszystkie' button.

- Create-react-app


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
