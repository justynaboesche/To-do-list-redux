# To-do list - react
![To-do list](public/To-do-list2.png) 
## Demo
[See my to-do list](https://justynaboesche.github.io/To-do-list-react/)
## Description
This is another version of to-do list created as part of YouCode course.

At the top of he application there is a navigation toolbar, which can lead you to the **tasks page** and to the **author page**.

The author page contains some info about me, whereas tasks page includes more complex interactions, devided into three parts:

1. **Adding tasks block**

In this part you can add new tasks to the list below and download example tasks by clicking "Pobierz przyk≈Çadowe zadania" button.

2. **Filtering tasks block**

Thanks to this part you can filter tasks from the list below.

3. **Tasks list block**

The last part allows you to:
- mark completed tasks,
- remove tasks from the list,
- hide and show tasks that are marked as done,
- mark all tasks as done. 

Moreover, each task contains a **subpage**, which shows details of the task. You can get to it by clicking on its content.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works

## Technologies used in the project
To create the application I have used:
- HTML 5
- CSS (Grid, Flex, media queries)
- Normalize.css
- JavaScript ES6+
- React
- Create-react-app
- WebPack
- Styled-components
- ThemeProvider
- React Hooks (useState, useState, useRef)
- Custom Hooks
- Local storage
- Markdown
- Promises, async/await
- React-Redux
- Redux-Toolkit
- Redux-Saga
- Redux-Router
- Generator function*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
